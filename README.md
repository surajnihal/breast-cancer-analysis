# Breast Cancer Detection using PCA and Predictive Modeling

This repository contains an end-to-end analysis of the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. It focuses on early detection of malignant tumors using shape-based features extracted from cell nuclei, with PCA used for dimensionality reduction and multiple classification models evaluated for performance.

ðŸ“¬ _This project supports the insights shared in the Substack post: [Breast Cancer in 2025](https://aixme.substack.com/p/breast-cancer-in-2025)_

## Dataset

- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)
- 569 samples, 30 numeric features + 1 target
- Target: `Diagnosis` (0 = Benign, 1 = Malignant)

---

## Modeling Approach

To address the class imbalance and maximize detection of malignant tumors, we applied two strategies:

**Data-Level (Resampling):**
- SMOTE + Logistic Regression
- SMOTE + Support Vector Classifier
- SMOTE + Random Forest

**Algorithm-Level (Built-in Balancing):**
- Balanced Random Forest
- Easy Ensemble

Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall (sensitivity), specificity, and F1 score.

## Results

Key results are summarized in the blog post [here](https://aixme.substack.com/p/breast-cancer-in-2025#:~:text=are%20the%20results..-,Results,-Before%20we%20jump).

Simpler models (Logistic Regression, SVC with SMOTE) showed strong balanced performance with easier deployment potential in clinical settings.
